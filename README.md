[//]: # "You’ll make one of these each day - just copy, paste, and edit the entry, keeping the most recent post at the top of this page. 
This reflection is what you’ll use to share out each day at standup.  
Remember however, that it is a guide only, and should be used accordingly."
[//]: # "***Lastly, please remember that this daily record is for you.  
While your coaches will use it as a soft point of accountability, 
you should use it only as much as it supports your reflections in learning.
Sentences, bullet points, paragraphs, copy and pastes are welcome!***"

| Reflection on what I learned today | I really enjoyed working with the .NET framework because it seems very straight forward on how to use it and it has lots of really nice app templates from the start. I also really like Microsoft documentation and learning modules. |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | I think today went very well because I was able get some actual coding practice in microsoft modules and also created my first C# project and did some practice examples.                                                              |
| Reflections for the following day  | So far I think the plan seems to be working, I need to make sure I stay focused on the current goals for the day to make sure I get a deep understanding before jumping into creating more complex apps.                               |

| Reflection on what I learned today | I enjoyed learning about LINQ and how to use it to filter and sort lists and arrays, and how the syntax is similar to SQL which made it easier to understand.                                                            |
| Reflection on how I learned today  | Today went well, I was able to code along a full C# tutorial going over the basic concepts for C#.                                                                                                                       |
| Reflections for the following day  | I need to make sure to stay on track with the current goals before I start digging into other rabitholes.                                                                                                                |
